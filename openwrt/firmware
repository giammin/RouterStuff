Backing up the old firmware:
    To backup the existing openwrt install, use the command:
      dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 of=/tmp/firmware.trx
    This will produce a file containing the trx of the current firmware
    (kernel and squashfs filesystems) followed by a dump of the jffs2
    partition (including all installed packages) following the trx data
    -- basically everything except the bootloader and NVRAM.

    To restore from such a file you'll need to use OpenWrt's mtd command:
      mtd -e linux -r write firmware.trx linux
    Other methods of reflashing are likely to stop at the end of the trx
    data, before restoring the jffs2 data.

Trx image files from bin:

dd bs=32 skip=1 if=original.bin of=original.trx

flash firmware
first line delete everything before flashing (-e linux)

mtd -e linux -r write openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux
mtd -r write openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux
